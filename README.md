This project aims to derive insights into a social media and content-creating company, SocialBuzz, from their data. Following are the steps that I have followed to complete the task.

Requirements gathering: The project started with gathering the requirements from SocialBuzz, which helped in understanding their objectives and the specific insights they were seeking from their data.

Data collection: The data collected from SocialBuzz, included various datasets related to social media and content creation. These datasets contained information such as user demographics, engagement metrics, content performance, and other relevant data points.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Python's pandas-profiling library was utilized to perform an initial exploration of the collected data. EDA techniques helped in understanding the structure, quality, and relationships within the datasets. It involved examining summary statistics, identifying missing values, checking data types, and analyzing distributions.

Data cleaning: After performing EDA, the data was cleaned to ensure its quality and consistency. This step involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, removing irrelevant data, and transforming data as necessary. Microsoft Excel was used for the cleaning process.

Data visualization with Power BI: Once the data was cleaned and prepared, Microsoft Power BI was utilized for visualizing the data. Power BI's interactive and customizable features allowed for creating informative and visually appealing dashboard.

Following is the analysis from the visualization and insights derived from the analysis:
